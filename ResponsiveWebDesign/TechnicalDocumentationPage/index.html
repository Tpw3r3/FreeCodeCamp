          <h2>Intro</h2>
        </header>
        <p>If you're looking for a fun party game to play with friends that may lead to some trust issues, but it sure to be a fun time, this is that game.</p>
        <p>I was first introduced to this game when I met up with a group of friends I hadn't seen in a while but had known for a long time. Some had played before and there was some, like me, who had been previously unaware of the game. Having experienced players present, helped with making it easier to understand and learn how to play. That's not always the case though, so hopefully this guide can help you and your friends play too.</p>
        <code>
          Good luck and...
          Welcome to the game of Mafia!
        </code>

          <h2>Game Setup</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Gather players. 12 to 16 is the ideal number of players. There can be a minimum of 6 or 7, but it's more fun with more people. Although, 20 or more players can be split into 2, or more depending on the number of people, separate games. 
        </p>
        <p>Players should ideally be set up in a circle or oval shape around the narrator, or host, of the game. Positioned to be able to see the other players in the game. Below is an example of a possible arrangement, with 15 to 16 people:</p>
          <pre><code>
            Narrator  
        Player      Player  
      Player          Player  
    Player               Player  
  Player                    Player  
    Player               Player  
      Player          Player  
        Player      Player  
        </code></pre>
        <p>Player roles can be chosen by the narrator, by picking cards predetermined to be associated with specific roles, or whatever other method the group of players sees fit.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Objectives">
        <header>
          <h2>Objectives</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Depending on your role, your objective changes.</p>
        <code>
          Mafia members need to take out the citizens until the mafia are the majority to win.
          Citizens need to survive, find the mafia members, and vote them out to win.
        </code>
        <p>*There are also special roles with their own objectives to win, which can be found under player roles.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Player_Roles">
        <header>
          <h2>Player Roles</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Below are the common roles.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Narrator:</strong> This is essentially the host of the game. They know who everyone is, and they keep the game moving. Awakening each role and asking them a question directly related to their specific role and ability. They also facilitate the vote to find the mafia members.</li>
          <li><strong>Mafia:</strong> The number of mafia members depends on the number of players in the game, but 2 is the ideal number. They kill the citizens at night and try to avoid getting voted out in the day. The mafia must agree on who to kill. They are the role that does the most lying during the game to cover their tracks and avoid suspicion. While it's helpful to keep each other in the game, the mafia members can turn on each other and vote each other out to avoid suspicion. If even one mafia member survives and finishes the game, all the mafia members win.</li>
          <li><strong>Citizens:</strong> These are the innocent members that are trying to survive the night and vote out the mafia members during the day. They have to pay attention to the other players and do their best to figure out who is suspicious.</li>
        </ul>
          <p>Below are the special roles. They have multiple different names, and the players decide whether to include these roles at the start of each game when the player roles are being selected. These players can choose if they want to reveal their roles but beware, because any player could be lying.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Angel, Nurse, or Guardian:</strong> This player is on the side of the citizens, but they have a special ability that allows them to protect one player of their choice during the night. They are allowed to save themselves, but there is a limit to how many times they can choose themselves. If the mafia try to kill the person they protected, the person survives, and everybody lives through the night.</li>
            <li><strong>Detective or Investigator:</strong> This player is on the side of the citizens and can find out whether one player of their choice each night is innocent or guilty.</li>
            <li><strong>Hunter:</strong> This player is on the side of the citizens. This player has the power to choose someone to take out with them if they are killed. So, they can guess who they think is a mafia member and choose that player to kill with them right after they die.</li>
            <li><strong>Sheriff:</strong> This player is on the side of the citizens. This player can take a shot at another player if they believe they've found a mafia member but should be careful to avoid killing the citizens and helping the mafia.</li>
            <li><strong>Jester:</strong> This player is a neutral player. This player wins by getting voted out in the daytime.</li>
            <li><strong>Fanatic:</strong> This player is a neutral player. This player wins by getting killed.</li>
            <li><strong>Soulmates or Lovers:</strong> This role is given to 2 players and if one of them dies, they both die.</li>
          </ul>

        <header>
          <h2>Variations</h2>
        </header>
        <p>There are multiple different versions of this game and similar games with different names. While this is to inform on the game of Mafia, there's various versions of the game with different names like Werewolves or Assassin. They have essentially the same premise with different player names. Another similar game you may have heard of and even played before, is Among Us. A digital game with a similar premise. There are also various other versions of this game, along with this version, that can be found in different types of media such as in shows or being played on YouTube. The games can vary slightly, but overall, the objective is the same.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Night/Day">
        <header>
          <h2>Night/Day</h2>
        </header>
        <p>1st Night:
        <code>The narrator has all the players close their eyes and then wakes up the mafia members by saying, "Mafia, wake up" so they can see their fellow mafia members. Then, the narrator has them close eyes back by saying, "Mafia, go to sleep." The narrator follows this by individually waking up and putting back to sleep all the other special roles in the game to make sure that everybody who got a special role, remembers their role.</code>
        </p>
        <p>1st Day:
        <code>The narrator has everyone wake up and introduces the game by telling a tale of where they are and hinting at what's to come. Whether the mafia will manage to take out all the citizens, or will the citizens prevail and catch all the mafia members. Only time will tell.</code>
        </p>
        <p>2nd Night:
        <code>This time, the narrator wakes up each role, individually, and asks them the question pertaining to their role, before putting them back to sleep. So, for the mafia, they ask who they would like to kill, and the mafia members will silently point and come to an agreement on one person before they go back to sleep. For the angel, they get asked who they would like to save and choose one player that is safe for the night before they go back to sleep. The detective gets to pick one person to find out if they are a mafia member or innocent and the narrator will mouth it to them or do some predetermined sign to let the detective know which the player they chose is, such as nodding that the person is the mafia or shaking their head that they're not the mafia, before going back to sleep. Any other roles in the game with special powers would also be asked a question regarding their role if applicable.</code>
        </p>
        <p>2nd Day:
        <code>The narrator wakes everyone up and updates them on what happened during the night. Informing the players on if the mafia killed someone and who. That player is then no longer allowed to talk unless they had the special role of the hunter, where the narrator will announce that the killed player does have the power to take a player out with them. They will then get to choose a player to kill with them. That player will also no longer be able to talk, and the narrator will tell everyone if that player was a mafia member or innocent. However, if during the night, the angel managed to choose to save the same person the mafia chose to kill, that person lives, and the narrator will announce there was a failed attempt to kill during the night. After the updates, the narrator will go around the group asking who each player is voting for and every time someone is voted for, they put a finger up. The 2, or 3 if there's a tie, players with the most votes will then plead their cases and the other players will all revote between the nominated players. Once a player has been voted out, they narrator will tell whether they were a mafia member or innocent. If the player was the hunter, the narrator will announce it and let the player choose another player in the game to take out with them.</code>
        </p>
        <p>And so on:
        <code>The nights and days will continue with the narrator asking the roles during the night their special questions. All the players that are killed or voted out are allowed to keep their eyes open and see who everybody is during the night, but can't say anything and shouldn't make a sound, to prevent giving anything away to the players left in the game. Even if the angel, detective, or any of the other special roles with special night abilities has already been killed, the narrator still tells them to wake up, even though they no longer have power, so that the other players in the game are unaware of what roles are left. The rounds continue until the citizens catch all the mafia members or until the mafia is the majority and the winners are determined. Depending on the special roles in play, there are ways for the game to end sooner if a special roles conditions are met, such as the jester getting voted out, which could happen from the 2nd day or later. The narrator keeps track of the players and will announce the winner or winners once the win conditions are met.</code>
